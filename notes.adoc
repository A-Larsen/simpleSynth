== Issues

=== Sound Device
using voicemeeter seems to cause issues. If you play sound directy through the
device instead than that seems to help

== TODO
* [X] get callback to read a file stream from a wave file

* [ ] get midi to work

* [x] play back wav files

* [ ] Make a volume envelope controler

* [ ] Create a Master clock set by bpm. Make this clock run in a tcp socket

* [ ] Make sure you can create a winMM callback in lua

* [ ] Make sure you only open the device once and use the same device for all
      wav data
